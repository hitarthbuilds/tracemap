# TraceMap

TraceMap is a Python execution tracing and runtime analysis engine.

It captures:
- function call structure
- control flow
- variable mutations
- execution cost

and exposes them as a structured execution graph.

This is a developer intelligence tool, not a debugger.


## Usage

Trace execution of a Python file and output a structured runtime snapshot:

```bash
python -m tracemap your_file.py > snapshot.json
